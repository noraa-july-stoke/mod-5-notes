First impressions are a HUGE deal when interviewing for a job or
presenting your portfolio projects to potential employers.

A visually satisfying portfolio project will more likely catch and
hold the attention of a potential employer than a portfolio project
that *lacks* visual appeal **regardless** of functionality.

To keep future potential employers and interviewers interested in your
portfolio project, you must make your portfolio project visually
appealing, otherwise you risk being passed over in favor of other applicants.

You might be thinking, "I have time to make it visually appealing after
I graduate from App Academy, so I don't need to worry about it now." This
is far from correct. You will be very busy leading up to graduation and
after graduation. Delaying the work on making your portfolio project
visually appealing now will delay your job search significantly.

CSS styling is a big part of making a full-stack portfolio project visually
appealing. You may find that the **majority of time that you spend on the
full-stack portfolio project is on CSS, and that is normal**. CSS is the
make-or-break factor of your portfolio project from a potential employer's
perspective.

The rest of this document is a guide to help you achieve a complete and visually appealing full-stack portfolio project.

## CSS Specifications

You must follow the design of the application you are cloning as close as
possible, down to the colors. App Academy is not a bootcamp for creating designers
and you are not training to be designers. The application that you are
cloning is already designed and you must replicate and implement the design
of the target cloned site through organizing your HTML elements and
styling them through CSS.

### TO DO CHECKLIST

**Important Note**: After finishing the basic functionality of your feature it's a good time to add limited styling so your workload is not as heavy later in the week.

- ✅ All links, buttons, input fields, and text features on the site are
  functioning properly and belong to the features that were worked on
- ✅ The alignment / justification of each element is consistent with the target
  cloned site
- ✅ The colors used on each element are comparable with the target cloned site or
  within professional standards
- ✅ The fonts & font sizes used on each element are comparable with the target
  cloned site
- ✅ [Google Fonts] or the built-in browser fonts must be used for fonts
- ✅ Your site has no glaring visual issues on a standard size laptop (needs
  to be a desktop version of the target cloned site - 1024px)
- ✅ The logo and name of your application are different from the target cloned
  site
- ✅ Your document page title and application's favicon match that of the name
  and the logo of your application
- ✅ The white spacing (padding, margin, border, and positioning) of each element
  are consistent with the target cloned site
- ✅ The box-shadows of each element are consistent with the target cloned site
- ✅ The buttons are consistent with the target cloned site
- ✅ The menus are consistent with the target cloned site
- ✅ The mouse-pointers are consistent with industry standards
- ✅ The hover effects on each element are consistent with the target cloned site
- ✅ The icons used are comparable with the target cloned site
- ✅ [FontAwesome] must be used for icons

- You can use FlexBox
- You can use Grid.css

### MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING

- ❌ Don't copy/paste the HTML element structure directly from the application that you
  are cloning
- ❌ Don't copy the CSS styling directly from the application that you are cloning
- ❌ Don't look at or copy the HTML element structure from another student's
  application
- ❌ Don't copy/paste the CSS styling from another student's application
- ❌ Don't work on CSS animations or transitions from target site
- ❌ Don't use any UI/CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Ant Design, etc)

**Important Note**: If you wish to use a CSS/JavaScript library or NPM package,
you must consult and get approval from your Project Advisor.

If you have any questions, or if you are not sure if your feature meets these
CSS completion requirements, please consult your Project Advisor.
