</p>

This is an outline of the steps you will take for your presentations of the
project on Monday of week 17. Grading takes place on the same day.

## Grading Format

- All grades are based on the scorecards you created for this project.
- Every select field must be marked as `Yes` in the following categories:
  - Base Requirements:
    - Auth and Splash/Landing
  - Core Functionality:
    - Feature 1 and Feature 2. Full CRUD for one feature, 3/4 CRUD for other feature. Update on feature 2 is the only one you can skip.

### Additional Conditions for Passing Mod 5

- No additional commits may be pushed after 8:00am PT on day of presentations.
  - If we suspect changes to the live deployed app were made during or after
    presentations we have other methods to check this.
- Grading will be done on your live site.
- Students will present to their respective teams.
  - Standups and presenting work to others is an important part of the regular
    job as a SWE. This is practice for that.
  - If you would like to practice/prepare, we recommend that you demo with yourself and your peers.
  - If you choose not to present on Monday, you still need to attend presentations with your team to show support.

## Presentation Format

Following all of these steps will satisfy every part of the scorecard except
parts of General Requirements. Instructors will grade that section later after
your presentations.

1. Demo splash page:

   - All links must be valid and cannot be dead. Be mindful of styling that
     looks like links but are not.

   - This must be intuitive. If you're not sure ask your peers if something looks like a link that would navigate you elsewhere.

   - Instructors will ask you to click on these links during presentation.

2. Auth

   - Sign Up:

     - Showcase validation errors first.
     - Sign up successfully.
     - Log out.

   - Log In:

     - Showcase validation errors first.

     - Log in with previously made user.
     - Log out.

   - Demo user:
     - Log in with demo user button. Recall this feature is on your scorecard.

3. Feature 1:

   - Create:

     - Showcase error handling for failed cases.
     - Successfully create item (whatever it is your website does).

   - Read:

     - Previously created item should now be visible somewhere. Showcase this.

   - Update:

     - Successfully update item.

     - Showcase item being changed.

   - Delete:

     - Delete item successfully.

     - NOTE: You may want to wait to do this if your second Feature depends on
       this first feature. You may circle back to this and showcase Delete for
       both features at the same time. This will speed up your presentation
       significantly.

     - Successfully showcase item is no longer present.

     - This INCLUDES scenarios where it should cascade Delete (i.e., Delete a
       "Spot" that has "Reviews/Bookings", now those should also have been
       deleted.

4. Feature 2:

   - Repeat all steps for Feature 1, but no Update.

   - Note, you may want to create TWO items. One to showcase individual Delete.
     Another to let your Feature 2 cascade Delete (if applicable).
